# Fcl file that only runs GENIE "All" variations
# Aim is to allow us to run more GENIE universes
# The limit from grid memory allocations is ~100 universes in each round of jobs
# To get around that, we provide 5 "extra genie all" fcl files, that will allow 
# analyzers to run extra "genie all" universes in subsequent jobs, to make up to
# 600 universes total (100 from run_eventweight_microboone_sep24.fcl, plus 100
# more from each of the five run_eventweight_microboone_sep24_extragenieall_X.fcls
